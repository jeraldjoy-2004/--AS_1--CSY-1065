    <h1>First of all i would like to thanks my professor Chris Rafferty to teaching this module and explaining each and everthing to me i'm really thank to you. my experience in this learing journey fantastic where i learned abot the  basics of web development and learing the coding and designing web site was quite challenging and fun. I made lot of mistakes in between writing the code but it was a lesson to make things right! and i'm glad of myself that i was consistent to learn and make things right. the website i insired from the colours we see in day to day life. and that is the main reson the website is so colourfull and vibrant as possible. and i kept the sites userinterface as clean as possible so the user can easily navigate through the tabs. the fornts/colours we see in this website is stock visual studio code fonts and colour but the css box-shadow i have used in home page is inspired from a website called "css scan" the one i got inspired is the rainbow shadow effect  (box-shadow: rgb(85, 91, 255) 0px 0px 0px 3px, rgb(31, 193, 27) 0px 0px 0px 6px, rgb(255, 217, 19) 0px 0px 0px 9px, rgb(255, 156, 85) 0px 0px 0px 12px, rgb(255, 85, 85) 0px 0px 0px 15px;) colour gride and box shadow are rest of it are my own creation. and if we come to the  teachnical base i only used HTML,CSS as i taught in the class and as it says on assessment brief to make this my website. and also i would like to mention what are the pages i have used in this web site. are 5 page in which in HTML there are contact page, home page, project page, report page, and a video deomonstration page. and if come to css i have used many myclass's to make it more aesthetic and beautiful.
